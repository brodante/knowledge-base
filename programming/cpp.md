# C++ Programming Roadmap in short 💻

Begin your C++ programming journey with this step-by-step guide, designed to take you from a novice to a skilled developer.

---

## 1. Understanding the Basics 📚
Learn the fundamental concepts of C++ programming.

### Key Areas:
- Syntax and Structure: Variables, data types, operators.
- Control Flow: If statements, loops (for, while).
- Functions: Declaration, definition, and calling functions.

### Practical Example:
Write a simple program to print "Hello, World!":

```C++[]
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
---

## 2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 🛠️
Understand and apply the principles of OOP in C++.

### Techniques:
- Classes and Objects: Define and use classes.
- Inheritance: Create derived classes.
- Polymorphism: Use virtual functions and inheritance.

### Example:
Create a simple class and use it:

```C++[]
class Animal {
public:
    void speak() {
        std::cout << "Animal speaks" << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Animal animal;
    animal.speak();
    return 0;
}
```

---

## 3. Data Structures and Algorithms 📊
Learn and implement essential data structures and algorithms.

### Techniques:
- Arrays and Vectors: Store and manipulate collections of data.
- Linked Lists: Understand singly and doubly linked lists.
- Sorting and Searching Algorithms: Implement algorithms like quicksort and binary search.

### Example:
Sort an array using quicksort:

```
void quicksort(int arr[], int low, int high) {
    // Implementation of quicksort algorithm
}
```

---

## 4. Competitive Programming 🏆
Enhance your problem-solving skills through competitive programming.

### Platforms:
- LeetCode: Practice coding problems.
- CodeChef: Participate in coding contests.
- Codeforces: Solve challenging problems and compete.

### Example:
Solve problems on LeetCode to improve your skills:

## 5. Advanced Topics 🚀
Dive into advanced C++ topics to deepen your knowledge.

### Areas:
- Templates: Understand and use templates.
- STL (Standard Template Library): Utilize STL containers and algorithms.
- Concurrency: Learn about multithreading and parallel programming.

### Example:
Use a vector from the STL:

```C++[]
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    for (int num : numbers) {
        std::cout << num << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
