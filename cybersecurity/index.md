## Roadmap: Steps to Begin Your Cybersecurity Journey

1. **[Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)](osint/)**
   - Learn to gather and analyze publicly available information using tools like [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/), [Maltego](https://www.paterva.com/), and [Google Dorks](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database).

2. **[Scanning](scanning/)**
   - Master port scanning with tools like [nmap](https://nmap.org/) to identify open ports and services.
   - Practice vulnerability scanning with tools like [Nessus](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus) or [OpenVAS](https://www.openvas.org/).

3. **[Gaining Access](gaining-access/)**
   - Explore exploitation techniques using frameworks like [Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/).
   - Understand reverse shells and zero-day exploits for gaining unauthorized access.

4. **[Stabilizing Access](stabilizing-access/)**
   - Use tools like [Meterpreter](https://metasploit.help.rapid7.com/docs/meterpreter) for maintaining access to compromised systems.
   - Implement backdoors and stabilize reverse shells.

5. **[Clearing Tracks](clearing-tracks/)**
   - Learn techniques to remove traces of your activity, such as log deletion and command history cleanup.
